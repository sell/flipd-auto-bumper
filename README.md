# Flipd Auto Bumper

#### This is a in browser extension to auto bump your flipd.gg threads.

This works by injected js into flipd site to automate the sending of a auto bump, it runs every hour but you can modify it to your liking.

### Installation Details

1) Edit the `manifest.json` file to include the thread(s) link you want bumped, reason for this is to not mess up your flow when browsing the site.

2) Make sure you add a `*` after the url, for example `"https://flipd.gg/thread-hello-world*"`

3) go to brave://extensions/ or chrome://extensions/

4) Load the unpacked folder 

5) Open and leave the tab open for it to auto bump

#### I made this in minutes for anyone looking for a simple option.

You can run have this running on a vps or your own pc.
