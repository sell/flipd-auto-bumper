#### This is a in browser extension to auto bump your flipd.gg threads.

### Installation Details

1) Edit the `manifest.json` file to include the thread(s) link you want bumped, reason for this is to not mess up your flow when browsing the site.

2) go to brave://extensions/ or chrome://extensions/

3) Load the unpacked folder 

4) Open and leave the tab open for it to auto bump
